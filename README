libktomgirl

This is just a library and gives no actual end user interface to Tomboy style notes. 

However, this can be used to build Tomboy like (note taking) capabilities into
another app as it will fully support the Tomboy file format xml file as well as
normal operations such as making a new note, deleting a note, searching, and
much, much more.

This has been created by taking the gnote code and ripping out all the glib and
gtk dependencies. Thus, this is the smallest, most portable implementation of
the Tomboy File Format reader and writer.
