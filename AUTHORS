Fred Ollinger <follinge@gmail.com> is the maintainer of KTomGirl.

This is mainly a merge of several projects including gnote (based on Tomboy) and knotes.

The purpose was to bring Tomboy goodness to a pure KDE4 environment. Also for
me to learn about how to code in KDE4/Qt4 as well as being an excercise in
reading differing coding styles.

The other authors are the Gnotes teams, the Knotes team, and the Tomboy team
(inadventantly when they were forked to make gnote).

Thanks to everyone who gave their time in making this project work.
